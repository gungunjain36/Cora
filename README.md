## Overview

We have often seen life insurance scams in India. We are trying to build a platform that uses blockchain to make life insurance more transparent and secure. We have thought that AI Agents can be used to verify the authenticity of the documents and claims. And post that the claims can be settled onchain. All the premiums will be collected in the escrow account and the claim amount will be transferred to the beneficiary after the verification. The platform will be a web app that will be used by the insurance agents and the customers. Also the policyholders can be rewarded for reporting the scams. 

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- AI Agents - Langchain / LlamaIndex
- Blockchain - Aptos
- Smart Contracts - Move
- Escrow - Aptos

## Architecture

We are using Aptos blockchain for this project. The smart contracts are written in Move. The frontend is built using ReactJS and the backend is built using FastAPI. The AI Agents are built using Langchain and LlamaIndex. For now the AI agents will verify based on the synthetic data generated by the  Once on production the AI agents will verify based on the real data that is available on the internet and the data from the policyholders provided we get the approval from the policyholders and the government agencies.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using ReactJS. It is a web app that will be used by the insurance agents and the customers. The app will be a single page app that will be used by the insurance agents and the customers. The app will be responsive and will be available on the web and mobile.

### Backend

The backend is built using FastAPI. It is a REST API that will be used by the frontend and the AI agents. The backend will be responsible for generating the synthetic data and the real data from the internet and the data from the policyholders.

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Move. They are responsible for the logic of the escrow and the claim settlement.

### AI Agents

The AI agents are built using Langchain and LlamaIndex. They are responsible for the verification of the documents and the claims.

### Escrow

The escrow is built using Aptos. It is responsible for the collection of the premiums and the settlement of the claims.
